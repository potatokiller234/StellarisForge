# How to use the editor for your first project

![Green](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57806930/231271317-e85843f5-da15-4ac1-b443-11fd051897b4.PNG)  
Note - You should only ever press RE-PARSE once if pressed more then one times it can fill the editor with junk  
2. Then place empire initializers on the grid to create spawn points for empires

3. Create a galaxy made of parsed solar system initializers and random_initializers  
Note - Random Initializers are random each time the map is played in stellaris. For example one game it could be a normal system, then next it could be an ether drake
